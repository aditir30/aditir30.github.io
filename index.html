				<h3> BIG DATA DEVELOPER • BARCLAYS GLOBAL SERVICE CENTER, PUNE, INDIA 		<span style="text-align:right;">Jul 2017 – Dec 2020</span></h3>
				<h4>Project #1: Real-time Data Warehousing</h4>

				<ul>
					<li> <b>Technologies:</b> Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Kudu, Unix, DevOps, Agile, Scrum</li>
					<li><b>Responsibilites:</b></li>
					<ul class="square-list">
						<li>Developed scalable streaming workflow to fetch enterprise data from Kafka queues using
							Apache Spark, perform data transformation (ETL) and load to a data store like Kudu.</li>
						<li>Optimized streaming pipelines to gain 40% performance improvement and ensured data is made
							available in near real-time for business to perform analysis.</li>
						<li>Design and developed audit and reconciliation framework to log and monitor data processing
							while streaming process executes. This resulted in 70% time saving in data post-processing
							as compared to legacy applications.</li>
						<li>Developed scripts to query Kudu tables to fetch data, create reports and send across
							business personnel.</li>
						<li>Act as primary point-of-contact for product development teams as well as for various testing
							and code deployment teams.</li>
						<li>Designed technical documentation and standards for onboarding uses cases that required real-time 
							processing.</li>
						<li>Core member of Centre of Excellence team for development, testing, code reviews and
							deployment of new use-cases.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h4>Project #2: History data Amendment utility</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> <b>Technologies:</b> Scala, Unix, SparkSQL, Parquet</li>
					<li><b>Responsibilites:</b></li>
					<ul class="square-list">
						<li>Design and developed a configurable file driven utility that will modify and/or update data
							in cases where table schema and/or table data need to be changed. This brought down the time
							required from months to weeks.</li>
						<li>Developed an audit and reconciliation framework to monitor job status and provide roll-back
							feature in case of issues or failures.</li>
						<li>Conducting sessions across business units to deliver the utility as per stakeholder
							requirements.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Academic and Personal Projects :</h2>
				<hr>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Recommender system using Collaborative Filtering:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>Developed a movie recommendation system using Python (without the use of available APIs) that utilizes computation power of Spark. 
							The system was implemented using two of the collaborative filtering algorithms – item-based and Singular Value Decomposition.</p>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Minimum wages through ages:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The aim of the project was to create an interactive multiform visualization system using the minimum wages dataset available on Kaggle.
							The analysis was done using python packages of Altair and Streamlit to visualize the results/trends.
							This project is deployed on Heroku and available at - <a href="https://uncc-va-streamlit.herokuapp.com/">Heroku App</a> </p>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Forum Application:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The purpose of this Android application was to allow users to create new forums, like/unlike forums, delete forums and add comments to forums.
							The signup and authentication were done by Google Firebase. Additionally, Firebase was used to store and manage forum data </p>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Coupon Recommendation System using Machine Learning Models:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The aim of the project was to predict the type of coupon to recommend to customers
							based on certain attributes known about the person. The prediction was performed
							using SVM and Random Forest Classifiers. Accuracy of the model was improved from 80%
							to <b>90%</b> using hyperparameter tuning.</p>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>COVID-19 trends in India:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The aim of the project was to analyze COVID-19 data for medical presentations. The analysis was done using Tidyverse package of R to ingest, transform and analyze COVID-19 datasets available in India. To plot the results/trends, GGPlot2 was used.</p>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Optimization of performance parameters on Hadoop:</strong>
						<ul>
							<p>The aim of the project was to tune parameters which affect performance of Hadoop and achieve maximum throughput. The project was done as part of fulfillment of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering.</p>
						</ul>
					</li>
